### 👨‍💻 About Me

🚀 I'm a **Software Engineer** with **3.5+ years** of experience delivering **robust, scalable, and secure backend systems** in the **Banking** and **Pharmaceutical** domains. I specialize in building **Java Spring Boot microservices** using **event-driven** and **REST-based MVC architectures**.

🏦 At **Cognizant**, I'm currently contributing to **ING Bank (Belgium)** on their Core Banking platform. where I design, develop, deploy, and maintain core integration microservices in the **Cards & Daily Banking** area. Developed and delivered **16+** RESTful microservices and enhanced **37+** existing services, significantly improving system performance, reliability, and scalability.

🌐 Previously, I worked for **Merck KGaA**, where I built Block Order Management System from scratch using Spring Batch and dynamic compliance rule engines to automate pharmaceutical supply chain workflows.

⚙️ Taking full ownership of the entire **SDLC**, I lead efforts from requirement analysis and backend development with **Spring Boot** and **Kafka**, through **unit/integration testing**, **code reviews**, and **CI/CD pipeline** setup using **Git**, **Azure DevOps**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**.

🎓 I'm also pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science** (Woolf University), further strengthening my understanding of **data structures**, **system design**, and **computer fundamentals**.

🧠 I love solving real-world problems through **code**, **architecture**, and **collaboration** — and I take pride in being a **full-stack engineer** who owns the product from **design to deployment**.
